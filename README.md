# Happiest-Countries

#### Results
After viewing the correlogram, we can see the data is highly correlated; because of this, we continue with Principal component analysis. We then create clusters from the PCA to determine the countries HELP should focus on. From our plot, we can see that 3 is the optimal number of clusters, and from these clusters, we can see that the PAM clustering is equivalent to k means clustering as there is a difference of only 2 out of over 150 countries.

After we separated the countries into clusters, we created data visualizations factored by cluster, with some of the top contributors from the PCA (GDP/capita, and Social Support. These visualizations show that cluster 1 is consistently (and statistically significantly) better off than the other 2. The countries in this cluster are the ones that are the happiest. Cluster 1 has 25 countries in it, a full list of these countries is displayed on the last page.
